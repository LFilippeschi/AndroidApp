# AndroidApp
I made this app as a start for learning how to create android apps. I explored Views, Intents how to create multiple activities in an app and link them together. I used Kotlin as the programming language. 

Download the app and try it out! I converted some of the projects I made in order to run on android. 

In the future I think that I will learn to use Flutter in order to be able to support multiple platforms at the same time. 
I learned a lot from this experience and I'm currently working on an app that I plan to release on the playstore once completed.
